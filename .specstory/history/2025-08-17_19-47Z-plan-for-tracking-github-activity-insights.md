# Plan for tracking GitHub activity insights (2025-08-17 19:47Z)

_**User (2025-08-17 19:12Z)**_

Ok, there's something we started doing when collection events from github

Let's craft a plans/github_activity.md with a detailed plan of what needs to change for us to start tracking and offering interesting insights to our organization

I have a bunch of people working on my org

I want to identify issues, prs, made by them to understand pulse of the company

you already know the types of events we're tracking

now I want to
- double check we're collecting and storing everything we need
- start exploring this data in the github section (ui) 
- add interesting insights in the home about this

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to create a comprehensive plan for tracking GitHub activity and offering insights for their organization. They have a list of organization members and want to:

1. Track issues and PRs made by them
2. Ensure all necessary data is being collected and stored
3. Explore this data in the GitHub section UI
4. Add insights to the home page

Let me first understand what's currently being tracked by looking at the schema and tools to understand the current state of GitHub event tracking.
